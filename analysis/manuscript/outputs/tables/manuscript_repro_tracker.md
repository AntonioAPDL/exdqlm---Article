## Artifact Status

- [reproduced] `ex1_model_output` -> `analysis/manuscript/outputs/logs/ex1_model_output.txt` (Example 1 model block). polytrend model object output.
- [reproduced] `ex1_run_summary` -> `analysis/manuscript/outputs/logs/ex1_run_summary.txt` (Example 1 textual outputs). Includes backend metadata and high-iteration trace diagnostics.
- [reproduced] `fig_ex1mcmc` -> `analysis/manuscript/outputs/figures/ex1mcmc.png` (fig:ex1mcmc). Trace and density plot using dedicated higher-iteration median MCMC run with thinning=5.
- [approximate] `tab_ex1_runtime` -> `analysis/manuscript/outputs/tables/ex1_runtime_summary.csv` (Example 1 runtime statements). Runtimes vary by hardware/profile; trace run intentionally uses higher iterations.
- [reproduced] `tab_api_migration_map` -> `analysis/manuscript/outputs/tables/manuscript_api_migration_map.csv` (global code migration). Maps deprecated manuscript calls to current package API.

## Notes

- api_update: Deprecated exdqlmChecks replaced with exdqlmDiagnostics.
- api_update: Deprecated y= usage removed from exdqlmPlot/compPlot/exdqlmForecast calls.
- ldvb_note: Added ISVB vs LDVB comparison figure for dynamic Sunspots example.
- backend: MCMC runs use C++ backend options exdqlm.use_cpp_mcmc=TRUE and exdqlm.cpp_mcmc_mode='fast'.
- ex1: Lake Huron uses cached fits; ex1mcmc uses a dedicated high-iteration median MCMC chain.
- coverage: Targeted run; requested targets: ex1mcmc.
- timing: Exact runtime printouts in manuscript are historical and expected to differ.
- scope: Main manuscript .tex was not modified; all updates are isolated under analysis/manuscript.
